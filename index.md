For this project, I was curious about how some digital businesses could bring economic growth to a country. I used data from iFood, the leading food delivery app in Brazil, which is present in over a thousand cities. I aimed to answer the question: 
**Are food delivery apps the new gold mines?**

In this case study, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data using data from the Massachusetts Department of Education Reports. The main focuses were:
**Which math schools in the state are known for having the worst performance?**

**Do schools in the same district have the same poor performance in math?**

**Which schools are struggling the most?**
