For this project, I was curious about how some digital businesses could bring economic growth to a country. I used data from iFood, the leading food delivery app in Brazil, which is present in over a thousand cities. I aimed to answer the question: 
**Are food delivery apps the new gold mines?**

#### [Education Project](https://www.loom.com/share/fa98daf23bd941e68c65c64718cef0d8?sid=de5fac8d-70ff-4bbe-8aed-40eff5c3ef63)

In this case study, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data using data from the Massachusetts Department of Education Reports. The main focuses were:

**Which math schools in the state are known for having the worst performance?**

**Do schools in the same district have the same poor performance in math?**

**Which schools are struggling the most?**

#### [Healthcare Project](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/empowering-healthcare-data-mariangel-reyes--s9xte/?trackingId=44mPzgeDQVCmS09R7i3b2g%3D%3D)

For this case study, I assumed the role of a Healthcare Analyst. I use data from 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery network health systems. The data spanned from 1999 to 2008 and I gained these key insights from the data I analyzed:

**- The majority of patients stay in the hospital between 1 and 7 days. The highest peak in the distribution occurred on day 3 with a total of 17,756 patients. Also, as the length of hospital stay increases, the number of patients decreases.**

**- Surgery-Thoracic, Surgery-Cardiovascular/Thoracic, and Radiology are the medical specialties with the highest average number of procedures. However, the medical specialty with the highest number of patients (5,352) is Cardiology, which reflects the fact that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.
The hospital treats patients of different races equally, as the average number of lab procedures is similar across all racial groups.**

**- There is a positive correlation between the average length of a hospital stay and the number of lab procedures performed. Hence, the category 'many' has an average hospital stay of 5.65 days.**

**- The hospital had records of patients who were admitted in an emergency (admission_type_id of 1) but stayed less than the average time. These patients had hospital stays as short as one day and did not require readmission.**
